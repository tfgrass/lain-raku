# Lain CLI Documentation

## Overview
The given code is the entry point for a command line interface (CLI) application named "Lain". The script imports several modules and uses them to run the CLI with the provided arguments. This documentation will detail each part of the code, including what it does, its functions, classes, and variables.

## Code Analysis

### 1. Module Imports
- `use lib 'lib';`: Adds the specified directory ('lib') to the module search path in Perl6. This allows the script to locate and use custom modules from this directory.
- `use Lain;`, `use Lain::CommandLoader;`, `use Lain::CommandRegistry;`, `use Commands::DocCommand;`, `use Lain::CLI;`: Imports the necessary modules for running the CLI application, including the main module (Lain), a command loader, a command registry, a documentation command, and the CLI module itself.

### 2. Variables
- `my @args = normalize-args(@*ARGS);`: This line creates an array called 'args' that contains the normalized command line arguments passed to the script when it is executed. The 'normalize-args' function is not defined in this code snippet, so its implementation and functionality are unknown from this documentation.

### 3. Function Calls
- `Lain::run-cli(@args);`: This line calls the 'run-cli' subroutine of the Lain module with the normalized command line arguments as an argument. The 'run-cli' function is responsible for setting up and running the CLI application using the provided input arguments.

## Conclusion
This code snippet serves as the entry point for the "Lain" CLI application, which utilizes custom modules to handle various commands and functionalities. By importing necessary modules and calling the 'run-cli' function with the command line arguments, this script enables the Lain CLI application to process user input and perform the intended actions.
